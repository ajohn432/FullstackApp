# FullstackApp
Fullstack application using a modern framework

Frontend:
Framework: React.js or Angular for building a responsive and interactive web UI.
Styling: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for CSS frameworks.
State Management: Redux or Context API (for React) or RxJS (for Angular).
Build Tool: Vite or Webpack for optimized development and production builds.
Backend:
Framework: ASP.NET Core (latest version) for building RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints.
Programming Language: C# for application logic.
Authentication and Authorization: ASP.NET Identity with support for OAuth2/JWT for token-based authentication.
Data Access: MongoDB .NET Driver for database interactions.
Database:
Database: MongoDB for storing unstructured or semi-structured data.
ORM/Abstraction: MongoDB .NET Driver or libraries like MongoFramework for easier integration and querying.
Hosting: MongoDB Atlas (managed cloud database) or self-hosted MongoDB on a server.
Deployment and Hosting:
Cloud Provider: Azure (since it integrates seamlessly with .NET applications).
Containerization: Docker for packaging the application and database dependencies.
Orchestration: Kubernetes or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for managing containers.
CI/CD: Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Monitoring and Analytics:
APM: Application Insights (part of Azure) for monitoring application performance.
Logging: Serilog for structured logging, with logs sent to Elasticsearch, Azure Monitor, or Seq.
Analytics: Google Analytics or custom dashboards using Power BI.
Example Workflow:
Frontend communicates with ASP.NET Core APIs using REST/GraphQL.
The ASP.NET Core Backend uses MongoDB to store data like user profiles, application settings, or logs.
Authentication is handled via OAuth2/JWT, providing secure access to the APIs.
The application is packaged with Docker and deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service.
Logs and performance metrics are monitored via Serilog and Application Insights.
This stack is highly scalable, leverages modern tools, and supports rapid development.
